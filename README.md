The Banana Project is my final year project. This project is developed using PHP for the backend, MySQL for the database, and JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend. To get started, clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/himashalakshani/BananGame.git, and follow the setup instructions to install dependencies and run the project. Feel free to contribute if you have any suggestions or improvements.
